## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I re-inforced my knowledge and use of semantic HTML5, and I also practiced more on writing good comments and commit messages (two different things)

### Continued development

I'm going to keep practicing on writing good HTML5 code and structuring properly, until I can write code that does not have any HTML issues.

### Useful resources

- [HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - This page lists all HTML5 tags and their uses. This helped me figure out how to structure my project's HTML.
